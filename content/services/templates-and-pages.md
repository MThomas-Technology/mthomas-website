# Templates and Pages

Building flexible, optimised templates for petitions/handraisers, email to target pages, donation pages or your custom campaign has been at the core of the work I do for many years. I have experience on most of the major eCRMs and online advocacy platforms such as Engaging Networks and ActionKit. If you don't currently use a platform for your campaigning, I can build stand alone pages and link them to your existing data systems.

Empowering non-technical people to build and run campaigns is important to me, so all templates are designed to be easily editable without requiring developer assistance.
