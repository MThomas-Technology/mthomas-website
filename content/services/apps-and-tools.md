# Apps and Tools

I specialise in building custom web-based applications, microsites and tools to help organisations reach their goals. I have a wide range of experience in developing a variety of applications, including:

- Interactive pages such as quizzes, maps and surveys to engage with exisiting supporters, recruit new supporters and spread awareness.
- Tools to connect your supporters with your services.
- Custom admin and reporting tools.
- Tools for publishing online campaigns and donation pages.
- API integrations to sync and pass data between your various pages and systems.

Whether you need to streamline an internal process or you're looking to engage with your supporters in a new way, I can help.
