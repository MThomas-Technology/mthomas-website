# Agencies and In-house

I have years of experience working in and leading small technical teams to deliver full-stack web development projects in dynamic, fast-paced environments. I am well-versed in modern HTML and CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, PHP and Laravel framework. I also have experience with other various web technologies and my experience allows me to pick up new technologies quickly.

If you are an agency or an organisation with an internal team that needs some additional expertise, wants to scale your capacity or needs to hit a deadline, I am available for short to medium term projects on day rate.
